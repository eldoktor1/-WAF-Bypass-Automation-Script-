🔥 WAF Bypass Automation Script 🚀

This script automates various bypass techniques for Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) using curl requests. It cycles through a list of user agents, headers, and URL modifications to find potential bypass methods. The script also includes random delays to help avoid detection.
Features ✨

    Randomized user-agents for each request 🕵️‍♀️
    Multiple bypass techniques, including URL encoding, SQL-like injections, and header manipulations 🛠️
    HTTP request headers to bypass common WAF defenses 📡
    Proxy support through proxychains 🌍
    Custom delay between requests to evade rate-limiting defenses ⏱️
